# Interdimensional Friend Finder
An Express-based web application allowing user's to find their closest match in their network.

## How it Works

The IFF runs on Express from the Node development environment. Users are encouraged to answer a brief questionnaire that has a twofold purpose: First, it runs their information through a preexisting database to pair them with the individual who answered the questionnaire in the most similar manner. After prompting each user with their nearest match, submission of the survey also adds the user's data to the API, allowing future users to access their data and view them as a match.
